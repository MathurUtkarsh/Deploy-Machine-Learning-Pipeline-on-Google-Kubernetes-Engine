# Deploy Machine Learning Pipeline on Google Kubernetes Engine

Deploying a machine learning pipeline on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) involves several steps:

1. Containerize the pipeline: The pipeline should be containerized using a tool such as Docker, so that it can be easily deployed on GKE.

2. Create a Kubernetes cluster: A cluster should be created on GKE using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud command-line tool.

3. Create a Kubernetes deployment: A deployment should be created in the cluster that specifies the container image, number of replicas, and other details.

4. Create a Kubernetes service: A service should be created that exposes the deployment to the outside world and allows external clients to access the API.

5. Create a Kubernetes ConfigMap or Secret: If your pipeline require any configuration files or secret keys, you may create a ConfigMap or Secret to store these files and keys respectively, and mount them as a volume to the pod.

6. Deploy the pipeline: The pipeline can be deployed to the cluster by applying the deployment, service, and configMap/Secret.

7. Monitor the pipeline: The pipeline can be monitored using Kubernetes tools such as kubectl and Google Cloud Platform Monitoring.

It's worth noting that the above steps are just a general overview and the specific details of each step will depend on the complexity of your pipeline, Kubernetes environment, and other factors.
